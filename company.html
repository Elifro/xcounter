            <h3 class="thinner">Our Value of Delivering Quality</h3>
            <p>ISO 9001:2008 is an established, international quality-management framework. It enables monitoring and continuous improvement of the way XCounter operates, whether that means reaching out to new or strengthening existing partnership agreements, driving down costs, managing risk more effectively or improving staff satisfaction. In short, the ISO 9001:2008 status recognises the high quality of XCounter's comprehensive business processes. ISO 13485:2012 sets internationally recognized standards ensuring a management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices. Also, it constitutes a key requirement for gaining regulatory approval for medical devices in major commercial markets, including the USA.
            <br><br>
                It is a true measure of any company to be ISO certified, particularly for a medical-device company such as XCounter. ISO certification is required by partners and purchasers of high-end technology of global interest. Thus, XCounter's ISO accreditation marks a key step forward in the commercialisation process of the company's proprietary X-ray technologies. Also, the ISO certification makes up an important step in the company's internal development, reinforcing the commitment to developing ground-breaking applications that deliver high levels of accuracy and precision. In addition, the ISO accreditation makes up an endorsement of Xcounter's high-quality intellectual capital and professionalism, which benefit all of the company's stakeholders.

        <div class='col-lg-6'>
            <h3 class="thinner" >Accreditation Processes</h3>
            <p>XCounter's key processes are certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and operates under ISO 9001:2008 as well as ISO 13485:2012. The company's ISO-certification status demonstrates that it meets an international set of standards and guidelines that are becoming vital components fÃ¶r conducting business in the global marketplace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='col-lg-6'>
            <h3 class="thinner" >About ISO Certification</h3>
            <p>Based in Switzerland, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global network that identifies what international standards are required by business, government and society. In XCounter's case, the two ISO ceritfications follow a stringent evaluation process conducted by the Swedish Standards Institute (SIS). SIS is the centre for work on standards in Sweden and a working partner in the European (CEN) and global (ISO) networks.</p>
